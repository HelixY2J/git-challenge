# Challenge
Git commits could pile up upon each other and before you know it something is broken and you can't find WHERE!
The best solution when tracing who broke something or what broke something is to revert to an older commit.

In this challenge the calculator is broken. Everytime you try to sum two numbers it fails! 
**Revert this branch to a state when it wasn't broken so you can find out which code broke it.**
